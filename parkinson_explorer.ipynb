        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system that primarily affects the motor system. The exact pathogenesis of PD remains incompletely understood, and current treatments focus on increasing dopamine levels in the brain. This poses a major challenge for the development of new and effective therapies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases, such as PD. To date, more than 50 GWAS studies of PD have been published, and these studies have identified a large number of genetic risk factors for the disease. The data generated by these studies is helping us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PD and to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification is a supervised machine learning task that involves training a model to predict the class labels of new data points based on a set of training data points with known class labels. Classification algorithms have been widely used in biomedical research to predict disease risk, identify disease subtypes, and develop personalized treatment plans.\n",

        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is still a need to identify new disease gene associations for PD. This research has the potential to generate new and improved hypotheses about the pathogenesis of PD.\n",
